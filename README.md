# ABC-flow
fluid to solid one way coupling simulation

I used paris fluid solver (in Fortran) to solve navier stokes equation for Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, along with Volume of Flow method to update states. In this study case, a ellipsoidal drop with high viscosity and certain boundary conditions is treated as a solid. This program solves the multi-phase fluid problem.

As a result, it is found that drop with different orientation in ABC flow would result in different trajectory.
